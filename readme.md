# FCC Responsive Web Design Project 3 - Product Landing Page

This is Project Number 3 for FCC (freeCodeCamp) wich asked us to build a simple Product Landing Page using HTML5 and CSS3 given specific stories. This is Project 3 of 5 that needed to be completed in order to get the Responsive Web Design Certificate.

### User Stories
* **User Story #1:** My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".

* **User Story #2:** I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.
* **User Story #3:** Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".
* **User Story #4:** I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link..
* **User Story #5:** When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page..
* **User Story #6:** I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".
* **User Story #7:** My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".
* **User Story #8:** Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
* **User Story #9:** The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for..
* **User Story #10:** The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
* **User Story #11:** Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".
* **User Story #12:** When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit) that confirms the email address was entered and that it posted successfully.
* **User Story #13:** The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
* **User Story #14:** My product landing page should have at least one media query.
* **User Story #15:** My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
